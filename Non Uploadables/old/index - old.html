<div class="headings">About</div>
<div class="description_textL">My name is <strong>Matt Agius</strong> and I am a <strong>programmer</strong> from Cary, North Carolina.  I am a 19 year old student, currently attending <strong>UNC Charlotte.</strong>  I have a passion for computer programming, and I plan to achieve a Bachelor’s degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>.</div>
<div class="description_textL">Some of my high school achievements include <strong><u><a href="#Adobe">Certification in 6 Adobe Programs</a></u></strong> and <strong><u><a href="#Microsoft">3 Microsoft Certifications</a></u></strong>.  These certifications demonstrate fluent knowledge and understanding of the software being tested.  I was accepted into the <strong><u><a href="#NTHS">National Technical Honor Society</a></u> (NTHS)</strong> in my junior year.  NTHS is a commitment and accepts only those who "cultivate excellence in today’s highly competitive, skilled workforce."  I am also a member of the <strong><u><a href="http://www.ghhsblackfalcons.com/" target="new">Black Falcons Cyber Security Team</a></u></strong> at Green Hope High School.  My team members and I compete in <strong>National Cyber Security Competitions</strong> against teams from all over the country.  We even used a <strong>flying video drone to live stream our football team's Homecoming game (<u><a href="http://usatodayhss.com/2014/north-carolina-high-school-uses-drone-to-live-stream-football-game" target="_new">USA Today Article</a></u>)(<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2014/10/13/cary-high-school-releases-drone-during-football.html?page=all" target="_new"><u>Triangle Business Journal Article</a></u></strong>) to generate donations for registration fees.  On my own, I have also had videos games, posters, and videos I created over the years <strong>featured by teachers and shown to students</strong>.</div>
<div class="description_textL">I have created work in a variety of digital mediums such as <strong><u><a href="digital_art.html" target="new">digital graphics and design</u></a>, programming video games and interactive media, and <u><a href="videos.html" target="new">video production and filming</u></a>.</strong>  Using Adobe Photoshop and other Adobe programs I have made a wide array of work ranging from posters to web animations for school projects and club's needs.  If I could create something that may be useful, I was always happy to help out.  In programming classes I regularly created games and software in VB and C#.  Before winter break, we had a <strong>computer set up in the hall where students could play games made in class by students</strong>. Everyone was very proud with how well the event turned out.  After having these experiences I was <strong>inspired to produce a short <u><a href="videos.html" target="new">documentary</a></u></strong> about The Cargo Hold, the programming classroom I was taught in.  I filmed the classroom for months and collected hours of footage to use in the film.  It was a wonderful learning experience that required a lot of <strong>time and commitment</strong>.</div>
<div class="description_textL">While at Green Hope High School, I also ran Cross Country for all <strong>4 years</strong>.  I kept running in Winter and Spring Track most years, only missing one season.  <strong>I am a captain</strong> for all of these sports where I use leadership skills to lead many runners through the workouts.  Outside of school, I have experience <strong>volunteering with the Y.M.C.A.</strong> with their <strong><u><a href="http://yguides.ymcatriangle.org/about-us" target="new">Y-Guides and Princesses program</u></a></strong>.  I have been volunteering for the <strong>past 5 years</strong> at their various camps in North Carolina.  As a <strong>trained volunteer</strong> I have been helping with camp activities and other needs.  As well, I am working a part-time job as a cashier at The Hot Dog Stand at <strong>The Raleigh Flea Market</strong>.  I started the job in the summer of 2013 and have continued working through the school year.  <strong>My references for these activities are available upon request.</strong></div>

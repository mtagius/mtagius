                "I was very excited about the <a>pwnagotchi project</a> when it first came out. It harnessed a known vulnerability in WPA/WPA2 wifi security and automated it in the form of a cute tamagotchi. When I ran the project myself I saw that after the pwnagotchi actually collected the wifi handshakes the wifi password cracking was entirely manual. I took a deep dive into password security and password cracking to develop <a>pwnagotchi tools</a>, a series of scripts that automate wifi password cracking. I researched and created a list of attacks targeted specifically at WPA/WPA2 wifi passwords, a long neglected target in traditional password cracking.",
